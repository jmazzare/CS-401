        <p>
            Every website expects to have users. The users all have roles.
            For example, if someone is logged out, they might be considered
            a "visitor". After they log in, they may become an "admin".
        </p>

        <p>
            What are the roles of a discussion board?
        </p>

        <p>
            <a href="https://www.phpbb.com/about/">phpBB</a>
            is an open source discussion board. Use a demo instance of
            phpBB to answer the following question.
            <a href="https://www.phpbb.com/demo/">phpBB demo instructions</a>
        </p>

        <h4>Preparation</h4>
        <p>
          <em>Before</em> logging in as an admin, register as a new user.
          <ul>
            <li>Login</li>
            <li>Logout</li>
            <li>Log into phpBB as the admin, as described
                in the instructions above.</li>
          </ul>

          From within the administrative control panel, find the
          user you created above.
          <ul>
            <li>Find where to change the permissions for this user</li>
            <li>Find the dropdown with permission types, and take
                note of the options.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>Requirements</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>What permissions are listed in the permission types for the user?</li>
          <li>For each of these permissions, describe that role in your discussion board:
            <ul>
              <li>What can that user do?</li>
              <li>What are some "actions" they will take?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Domain Name</h3>
        <p>
          Find a domain name that fits the theme of the website.
          You <strong>do not</strong> need to purchase the domain name,
          only find one.
        </p>

        <h4>Requirements</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>What is the domain name?</li>
          <li>Explain how/where you found this domain name.</li>
          <li>What is the intended use of the TLD you chose?</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="section" id="due-dates">
        <h2>Due Date</h2>
        <p>
          The assignment is due by the end of the day (midnight),
          Thursday Sept 5th.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>
          Finish the work above in a file <samp>./YOURNAME.txt</samp>.
          <ul>
            <li>Plain text only.</li>
            <li>No Word docs, no PDFs, no RTFs.</li>
          </ul>

          From the directory containing your work,
          run the <code>submit</code> command from <code>onyx</code>.

          <pre><code>
          submit joeymazzarelli cs401 p1
          </code></pre>

          This command will pick up all files in the current directory
          (as well as any subdirectories recursively)
          and time-stamp them before transferring the combined files
          to the instructorâ€™s account.
          This semester you will build a discussion board.
