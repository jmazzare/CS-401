*** Analysis:
For each scenario, decide which HTTP status code and message should be sent to the client.

*** Requirements: 5pts
Name the status codes and message for each part.
**** 1.1.1
The client has requested the homepage, and the server successfully renders and returns the home page.

The client requested a product from an ecommerce site, but the ecommerce website cannot find that product it the database.

** Redirect Header
*** Scenario:
Your website had a page at:

/blog-posts.php?uuid=xyz123 (The "old" URL)

After a redesign of the website, you want to change the url to:

/blog/posts/xyz123.html (The "new" URL)

You have been asked to write the code to redirect HTTP requests for the old URL to the new URL.

*** Analysis:
You need to decide:
- What HTTP status code you will send to the client (browser)
- What HTTP header you will send to the client (browser)

*** Requirements: 5pts
**** 1.2
For an incoming request to "/blog-posts.php?uuid=xyz123", write out, in plain HTTP text, the first two lines of the server response that will redirect the client to "/blog/posts/xyz123.html"

Find or create a logo image that pertains to the topic of your discussion board.

*** Image Requirements 3pts
